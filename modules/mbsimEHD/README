CMake is used as build system. Assuming you are in the directory of this README-file

1. create a build-directory
   > mkdir BUILD
   > cd BUILD
   
2. run cmake in the BUILD Directory
   > cmake <options> ..
   
   important options:
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX (where to install the library)
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None/Debug/Release (Release is the default)
    
3. Build (and install) the library
   > make 
  (> make install)
